### Execution
```
g+++ palindrome.cpp
./a.out
```

### Complexity
As the string will be traced till half it's length, the complexity is O(n/2) i.e. O(n).

### Others
- This function supports numbers also. For ex: 1a2 will be "NOT palindrome".
- All the special characters will be ignored. For ex: !aba# will be "a palindrome".
