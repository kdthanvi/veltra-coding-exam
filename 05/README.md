## Distributed Systems
- In most simple language, distributed systems are multiple instance of any application working concurrently to server the end user resquest irrespecitve of the dependency on a single specific instance.

**A distributed system** _is an application that executes a collection of protocols to coordinate the actions of multiple processes on a network, such that all components cooperate together to perform a single or small set of related tasks._ [[Reference]](http://www.hpcs.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~tatebe/lecture/h23/dsys/dsd-tutorial.html)
